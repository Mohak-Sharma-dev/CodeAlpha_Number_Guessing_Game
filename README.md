# Number Guessing Game  

This project is a simple number guessing game created as part of the CodeAlpha internship program. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as random number generation, input validation, and error handling.  

---

## Features  

- **Random Number Generation**:  
  A random number between 1 and 1000 is generated using the `srand` function, ensuring a unique number on each run.  

- **Hints for Users**:  
  - If the guess is **within 10** of the actual number, the program provides an encouraging hint.  
  - If the guess is **outside 10**, it guides the user to narrow their range.  

- **Error Handling**:  
  The program validates user input, ensuring only whole numbers between 1 and 100 are accepted.  

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
  The game runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux, provided the necessary libraries are installed.
